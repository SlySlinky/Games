What is the meaning of life?
Your friends... what kind of... people are they? I wonder, do those people... think of you... as a friend?
The right thing... what is it? I wonder.. if you do the right thing... does it makes... everybody... happy?
Your true face... what kind of... face it is? I wonder... the face under the mask... is that... your true face?
You... what makes you... happy? I wonder...what makes you happy... does it make... other people happy, too?
How did the universe really begin?
